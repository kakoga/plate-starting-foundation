# Starting Foundation
A Skeleton (Temp)Plate for Zesty.io that is used as the example repo in the template creation doc: [https://developer.zesty.io/docs/templating/building-a-template-with-github/](https://developer.zesty.io/docs/templating/building-a-template-with-github/)

Zesty.io templates are comprised of multiple files that tell Zesty.io how to build a starting content configuration, and which HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to install. Templates also tell Zesty.io what to typefaces (e.g. Google Fonts) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. jQuery) to start with.

This is the starting foundation for creating a template in Zesty.io
